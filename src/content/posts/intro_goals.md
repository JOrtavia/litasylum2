Hello! My name is Jazmine and I'm the human behind The Literary Asylum. 

I am a former bookseller, writer, and future librarian with an interest in genres from literary fiction to dark romantasy. You will see a good mix of books on this site and on my Instagram as I try to read as diversely as possible. Literary Fiction is my go to genre as it's the genre I'm currently writing in, but don't let that scare you. You'll see quite a bit of cozy fantasy and romantasy these days.

The above photo consists of several books that are 400 pages and longer. I will be reading at least one of these per month because I have a page count goal 20,000 pages. That's right! I'm going to focus on page count rather than number of books but I do have a reading goal of 36 books. To break it down, I'm planning on reading 12 big books, 12 audiobooks, and 12 smaller books or books less than 400 pages. If you would like to keep up with how I'm doing, I just joined The Storygraph as thelitasylum. Come be my friend! Or you can just follow me on Instagram at literary_asylum. I'll be there! Of course, I will be here too, posting my reviews so stay tuned!
